Data from [readmspa](http://readmspa.org/search/search=6.html), trained using [markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify).

## Usage
* Install dependencies (python3, bs4, markovify)
* Run scrape.py. This will take a while the first time while the models are generated. 
* Follow onscreen prompts to select character.


## Examples (try to figure out who's who!)

* That makes sense, but I'm not ready to get married and have babies!!!
