# Makarakov
Markov chain trained on Homestuck full text.

Data from [readmspa](http://readmspa.org/search/search=6.html), trained using [markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify).

## Usage: 
* Install dependencies (python3, bs4, markovify)
* Run scrape.py. This will take a while the first time while the models are generated. 
* Follow onscreen prompts to select character.


## Planned Features
- [ ] Command-line tool (e.g makarakov karkat 100 -> 100 lines of karkat)
- [ ] Nice refactoring
- [ ] requirements.txt
